# GamaPad

Simple python script to listen and handle gestures on the touchpad, designed for Linux Ubuntu (needs testing on other distros).

Configure the handling as you wish.

I'm working on finding a better and easier way to run it in background. For now you can simply:
```
sudo python3 app.py
```
